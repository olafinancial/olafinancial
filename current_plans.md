#### R29. App-Wide Insights & Alerts Engine
* **Status**: ✅ Completed

After data loads, `WPInsights.evaluate()` injects animated insight cards with colour-coded severity levels (`critical`/`warning`/`info`/`success`) and dismiss buttons.
  * **30+ rules** covering: income diversification, FX exposure, tax burden, food spending ratios, subscription costs, debt-to-income ratio, negative amortization, asset concentration, emergency fund coverage, insurance gaps, savings rate, and high-inflation environment.

#### R31. Live Macroeconomic Data Feed (`/api/econ`)
* **Status**: ✅ Completed
* **Description**:
  * New server route `GET /api/econ` serves `server/data/econ-ng.json`.
  * Dashboard fetches this on every load and populates the macro card dynamically (inflation, MPR, GDP per capita, FX rates, foreign reserves).
  * Data file is manually maintained — update figures when NBS/CBN publish new releases (monthly for inflation, quarterly for GDP).
  * **How to update**: Edit `server/data/econ-ng.json` with latest values and commit.

## E2E and Unit Test Coverage

#### Playwright E2E Suite
* **Status**: ✅ Green on Chromium + Firefox (120 tests); WebKit/mobile runnable (118/120 — offline PWA flaky on WebKit only)
* **Suites**: `01-auth` … `09-smoke` (auth, dashboard, income/expenses, debt, balance sheet, calculators, reports, settings/PWA, full-route smoke incl. Settings + Insurance)
* **Unit**: Jest — 30/30 passing
* **CI**: Runs automatically on push/PR via GitHub Actions
* **Local recipe**: `npm run dev` (terminal 1) + `npx playwright test --project=chromium` (or chromium+firefox)

---

### Session 8 — 2026-07-12 — E2E Troubleshoot & Stabilization

#### R33. Playwright E2E suite repair & hardening
* **Status**: ✅ Completed
* **Context**: Prior run artifacts showed mass failures (`ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`, missing browser deps, stale auth). Re-reviewed `current_plans.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `TESTING.md`, then diagnosed and fixed root causes.
* **Root causes fixed**:
  1. **Dev server required** — E2E targets `http://localhost:3000`; without `npm run dev`, all navigations fail.
  2. **Global setup login detection** — waited for non-existent selectors (`.dashboard`, `#dashboard-page`). Real markers are `#dash-kpis`, `#dash-greeting`, `.app-shell`. Login succeeded but auth state was not saved.
  3. **Hash route inconsistency** — app registers `/settings`, etc.; tests used `#settings` / `#dashboard` (no leading slash), so Settings currency test never saw `#set-currency` and smoke routes could silently fall back to Dashboard.
  4. **Watermark test called `window.print()`** — blocked/hung Firefox on Export PDF; now asserts print header + CSS `pul.llc` watermark rule without opening the print dialog.
  5. **Smoke treated third-party 5xx as app failures** — Google Fonts 503s failed Firefox; smoke now ignores non–same-origin responses.
* **App fix**:
  * `js/router.js` — normalize bare hashes (`#settings` → `/settings`); listen for `hashchange` so direct hash navigations (tests, deep links) dispatch correctly.
* **Test / docs files touched**:
  * `tests/e2e/global-setup.js`
  * `tests/e2e/02-dashboard.spec.js`, `06-calculators.spec.js`, `07-reports.spec.js`, `08-settings-pwa.spec.js`, `09-smoke.spec.js`
  * `TESTING.md` — local recipe, hash-route note, known env issues table
* **Verification (this session)**:
  | Layer | Result |
  |-------|--------|
  | Jest unit | 30 passed |
  | Chromium E2E | 60 passed |
  | Firefox E2E | 60 passed |
  | WebKit + mobile | 118 passed / 2 failed (offline PWA `setOffline`+`reload` WebKit internal error only) |
* **Environment notes (not code)**:
  * Node is via **fnm** — `sudo npx` fails (sudo strips PATH); use `sudo apt-get install …` or `eval "$(fnm env)"` first.
  * Pop!_OS apt noise: Launchpad PPA `system76/pop` has **no `noble` suite** — disable `system76-ubuntu-pop-noble.sources` so `apt update` is clean (system already has WebKit libs; WebKit launches OK).
* **Follow-ups (not done today)**:
  * Harden offline PWA test for WebKit/mobile (the 2 remaining failures).
  * R17 Budget Planner / 50-30-20 still planned.
  * Sponsor partners (#28) and recurring macro data (#29) still open.

### Suggested build order

1. **#38** Email ops (Supabase Auth SMTP + Resend digests on always-on host)  
2. **#28 / #29** Sponsors & monthly macro data  

### Product complete for main UX streams (2026-07)

* Sensible path batch, MTM assets, budget clarity, productive BS, strategic reports  
* Branding to **pul.llc** / Pul Planning  
* Sharia tools (Takaful pref, Zakat, Qard Hasan, Halal invest tips) — not app-wide filter  
* **Settings → Testing & account**: Reset data, Load demo data, Delete account (API)

### Session 23 — 2026-07-20 — Calculator share + digests in Settings (#76, #78)

* **#76 Share**: Calculators page **Share result** (header + footer) captures active tab via `WPUtils.shareBrandedCapture` (html2canvas + pul.llc watermark + Web Share / PNG download + invite copy with `https://pul.llc`)
* **#78 Digests**: Removed Scheduled & Email Reports card from Reports; single home is **Settings → Email Digest & Scheduled Reports**; Reports shows a pointer link
* **Shared helper**: `shareBrandedCapture` / `calcShareCopy` in `js/utils.js` (Reports share refactored to use it)
* **Cache**: `BUILD_ID` `20260720_share`, SW `pul-planning-v25`

### Session 22 — 2026-07-20 — Six PAYE deductibles (#75)

* **Source**: NTA 2025 §30(2) (BusinessDay / PwC) + customer: six tax-free items, not three toggles
* **The six**:
  1. Pension (Pension Reform Act — 8% + approved AVC)
  2. NHF (2.5% of basic)
  3. NHIS
  4. Mortgage interest on owner-occupied residential housing (interest only)
  5. Life insurance / deferred annuity premiums (self + spouse)
  6. Rent relief — 20% of annual rent paid, max ₦500,000
* **Engine**: `WPUtils.summarizePIT` / `calcPIT` / `calcRentRelief` / `calcNHIS` — all six reduce chargeable income; legacy `calcPIT(gross, pension, rent)` kept
* **Salary calculator**: numbered UI for all six; breakdown shows payroll withholdings (1–3) + tax reliefs (4–6) + PAYE; net = Gross − 1 − 2 − 3 − PAYE
* **Income form**: same six fields; auto-calc uses full stack; relief detail stored in notes tags
* **Tests**: unit suite covers rent relief cap + all-six vs pension-only
* **Cache**: `BUILD_ID` `20260720_paye6`, SW `pul-planning-v24`

### Session 21 — 2026-07-20 — P0 customer issues (#77, #74, #73, #80, #79, #71)

* **#77 Invest profile persist**: Restore results after re-login when answers are complete; recompute missing `result`; persist via `localStorage` + `WPDb.updateProfile` + `WPDb.client().auth.updateUser` metadata (`wp_invest_quiz`). Fixed broken save that called non-existent `WPDb.updateProfile` and `window.supabase.auth` (factory, not client). Maps quiz `balanced` → schema `moderate`.
* **#74 Retirement**: MTM stays on Assets only; Retirement shows a pointer card (no ticker MTM UI).
* **#73 Assets heading**: Renamed **Equities — Mark-to-Market** → **Marked to market**; copy covers equities, bonds, gold, commodities with tickers.
* **#80 FI score**: Full-width hero card on Dashboard and Reports (`fi-score-card`); ratios row labels FIS.
* **#79 Landing**: Tagline / feature — *Determine your Financial Independence Score*.
* **#71 Compliance**: `APP_CONFIG.disclaimer` replaced with customer compliance statement (educational/admin only; not a broker/adviser).
* **Cache**: `BUILD_ID` `20260720_p0`, SW `pul-planning-v23`.

### Session 20 — 2026-07-16 — Popstate Duplication, Blank Screen & E2E Test Fixes

* **Fix**: Added current path check `if (path === _current) return;` to `popstate` listener in `js/router.js` to stop duplicate dispatch loops.
* **Fix**: Implemented robust `typeof` checks for all registered page modules in `js/app.js` to prevent fatal ReferenceErrors on boot when browsers load cached `index.html` copies.
* **Fix**: Configured custom reload fallback inside `js/app.js` to gracefully show a reload action card instead of a blank screen when page modules are missing.
* **E2E**: Cleaned up the `/salary-calc` redirection logic in `js/app.js` to navigate cleanly to `/calculators` and resolved CSS selector format bugs in E2E tests, resulting in a 100% pass rate (70/70 passed).

---

### Session 19 — 2026-07-16 — Salary Calculator under Calculators hub

* **Change**: Full **Salary Calculator** (gross→net, NHF, rent relief, tax-year ledger) replaces the simple **Nigeria PAYE (SME)** tab on **Calculators**
* **Nav**: Removed standalone “Salary Calculator” menu item
* **Legacy**: `#/salary-calc` redirects to `#/calculators` with Salary / PAYE tab open
* **Income** page link opens Calculators → salary tab

### Session 18 — 2026-07-16 — Test without deleting account + plans refresh

* **Problem**: Customer wanted to delete/recreate account to retest features  
* **Solution (preferred)**:
  1. **Reset my data** — wipe financial tables + local prefs; keep email/password; reopen onboarding  
  2. **Load demo data** — sample income/expenses/assets/debts for click-through testing  
  3. **Delete account** — `POST /api/account/delete` (needs `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` on API host) so email can re-signup  
* **Files**: `js/supabase-client.js` (`resetUserData`, `seedDemoData`, `clearUserLocalState`), `js/pages/settings.js`, `server/routes/account.js`

### Session 17 — 2026-07-15 — Sharia tools (not app-wide mode)

* **Scope**: Takaful/Sharia helpers without filtering the whole app
* **Settings**: Sharia & Takaful preference (shared with Insurance)
* **Zakat**: Calculators tab + `WPUtils.calcZakat` + prefill from Assets
* **Debt**: Interest-free / Qard Hasan guidance; non-interest balances listed; Liabilities type `qard_hasan`
* **Invest**: Halal-conscious notes on quiz results; Assets optional `[sharia:yes]` tag on ticker holdings
* **Insurance**: already had Takaful wizard; preference sync via `APP_CONFIG`

### Session 16 — 2026-07-15 — Close R17 Budget (#32) & BS split (#36)

* **#32**: Budget Planner already had 50/30/20 rings, mapping, custom %; added net-income override, recommended ₦ amounts, budget-vs-actual traffic lights; Expenses link to Budget
* **#36**: Already shipped as `#/assets` + `#/liabilities` + Balance Sheet overview; clarified Overview subtitle links

### Session 15 — 2026-07-15 — Finish branding / domain #23

* **Status**: ✅ Completed · closes [#23](https://github.com/olafinancial/olafinancial/issues/23) (#25 was duplicate)
* `CNAME`, `index.html`, `manifest.json`, auth redirects already on **pul.llc** / **Pul Planning**
* **This ship**: `supabase/config.toml` site_url + redirect allowlist (pul primary, olafinancial bridge), report share URL, digest default `APP_URL`, server log / footer, package description

### Session 14 — 2026-07-15 — Strategic plain-language Reports (#49)

* **Status**: ✅ Completed · closes [#49](https://github.com/olafinancial/olafinancial/issues/49)
* **`WPUtils.buildStrategicHealthReport`**: 10-check narrative (income/passive, expense cover, passive+EF, assets, liabilities, net worth, retirement, insurance, investments, estate)
* Traffic-light status + CTAs; opportunity cards for lead-gen style next steps
* **Reports page**: “Your Financial Health Report” card at top of share/export area (included in Share PNG)

### Session 13 — 2026-07-15 — Productive Balance Sheet (#50)

* **Status**: ✅ Completed · closes [#50](https://github.com/olafinancial/olafinancial/issues/50)
* **Classification**: Assets → income-generating vs non-income (existing flag); Liabilities → interest-bearing vs non-interest (user toggle)
* **`WPUtils.productiveBalanceSheet`**: totals, coverage ratio, grade, plain-language narrative
* **Balance Sheet**: comparison card + bars + report text

### Session 12 — 2026-07-15 — Budget Savings & Debt Payoff clarity (#46)

* **Status**: ✅ Completed · closes [#46](https://github.com/olafinancial/olafinancial/issues/46)
* **Bug**: Ring stayed at 0% because classifier only matched snake_case `investment` / `interest_debt`, while Expenses store labels **Investment** and **Interest & Debt**
* **Fix**: Normalize category labels; map Investment + Interest & Debt → Savings/Debt bucket
* **Liabilities**: If no debt expenses, use **monthly_payment** schedules from Liabilities so adding a loan can populate the ring
* **UX**: “What these rings track” explainer, empty-state how-to, Investing vs Debt breakdown under the ring, CTAs to Expenses / Liabilities / Debt simulator; expense form tips when those categories are chosen

### Session 11 — 2026-07-15 — Sensible path batch + MTM under Assets

* **Status**: ✅ Completed
* **Sensible path** (`7013c21` and prior): Goals-first getting started, Income Statement nav/titles, salary deductibles → net, cash-flow category inflows, insurance NGN brackets — closed **#43, #44, #45, #42/#34, #48**
* **#47 Mark-to-market**:
  * Equity MTM UI moved from **Retirement → Assets**
  * Add Asset form: **Manual** vs **Ticker (mark-to-market)** radio + explainer
  * Live quotes via shared `WPUtils.fetchMarketPrice` / `estimateMarketPrice`
  * Notes tags: `[ticker:…] [qty:…] [unit_cost:…]`; closing balance synced to market
  * One-time import of legacy `wp_ret_stocks_*` localStorage into equity assets
  * Retirement keeps a link to Assets and still folds equity MTM into projections

* **Status**: ✅ Completed
* **Branding / Domain**: Confirmed custom domain `pul.llc` and updated redirect scope.

* **E2E Stability**: Resolved a test suite blocker where the onboarding step count was expanded from 5 to 6 in Session 9e, causing the global Playwright E2E setup script to time out. Tests are 100% green now (69/69 passed).

### Session 9d — 2026-07-13 — Auto cache refresh (no hard refresh) (#40)

#### R38. Customers always get new deploys without hard refresh
* **Status**: ✅ Completed (closes #40)
* **Issue**: [#40](https://github.com/olafinancial/olafinancial/issues/40)
* **Problem**: Service worker was **cache-first**, so browsers kept stale JS/CSS until a manual hard refresh.
* **Solution**:
  * SW **network-first** for HTML/JS/CSS; falls back to cache only when offline
  * New SW activates immediately (`skipWaiting` + `clients.claim`); clients auto-reload once on `controllerchange`
  * `js/cache-control.js`: purge Cache Storage + unregister SW on **sign-out**; clear caches on **pagehide/beforeunload** (leave/close)
  * Server `Cache-Control: no-cache` for `index.html` and `sw.js`
  * Build id in `cache-control.js` / `sw.js` — bump when changing cache policy
* **Preserved**: user data in `localStorage` (e.g. stock holdings, page currency prefs)
* **Ship commit**: `693ef81` (implementation); docs/issue linkage in this update

### Session 9c — 2026-07-13 — Social profiles (#39)

#### R37. Official social links in product UI

  * Instagram: [instagram.com/pulplanning](https://www.instagram.com/pulplanning/)
  * Facebook: business share link (see `APP_CONFIG.social.facebook.url`)
* **Implementation**:
  * `APP_CONFIG.social` + `brandSocialHTML(variant)` in `js/config.js`
  * Auth login/signup brand panel; logged-out screen; sidebar footer (compact icons)
  * Meta `twitter:site` / `twitter:creator` → `@pulplanning`
  * Goals social share copy → `#PulPlanning`
* **CSS**: `.brand-social` / `.brand-social-link` (and compact icon-only variant)

### Session 9b — 2026-07-13 — Email ops checklist (#38)

#### R36. Document production email setup (auth + digests)
* **Status**: 🔲 Open (docs done; production wiring pending)
* **Issue**: [#38](https://github.com/olafinancial/olafinancial/issues/38)
* **Doc**: [`EMAIL_SETUP.md`](./EMAIL_SETUP.md)
* **What must happen**:
  1. **Supabase Auth** — Site URL + redirect allowlist for pul.llc (and bridge); test password reset; optional custom SMTP / templates.
  2. **Resend** — account, verify `pul.llc`, `RESEND_API_KEY` + `RESEND_FROM`.
  3. **Always-on Node host** — digests cannot run on GitHub Pages alone; env includes Supabase service role + `APP_URL`.
  4. Smoke: `GET /api/digest/run`, then confirm 07:00 UTC cron.
* **Code already shipped**: R13 / #31 (digest feature); this issue is **ops**, not feature build.

* **UI**:
  * Sidebar, auth (login/signup/forgot), onboarding, and splash use `<img class="brand-logo">` + **Pul Planning** (removed “Financial Health” subtitle)
  * CSS: `.brand-logo` sized ~44–64px height (`object-fit: contain`, light background for mark)
  * `APP_CONFIG.appName`, disclaimer, manifest name/short_name, page title / PWA title
  * Report print headers → “Pul Planning”
* **Out of scope**: full string purge, domain cutover (see `DOMAIN_MIGRATION.md`), GitHub org rename
